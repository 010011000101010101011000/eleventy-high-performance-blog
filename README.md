# eleventy-high-performance-blog

A starter repository showing how to build a blog with the Eleventy static site generator implementing a wide range of performance best practices.

Based on the awesome [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).

## Dev


### Build, serve, watch and test
```
npm run watch
```

### Build and test
```
npm run build
```

### Performance outcomes

- Perfect score in applicable lighthouse audits (including accessibility).
- Single HTTP request to [First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/).
- Very optimized [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (score depends on image usage, but images are optimized).
- 0 [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/).
- ~0 [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/)

### Performance optimizations

#### Images

- Immutable URLs.
- Downloads remote images and stores/serves them locally.
- Generates multiple sizes of each image and uses them in **`srcset`**.
- Generates a **blurry placeholder** for each image (without adding an HTML element or using JS).
- **Lazy loads** images (using [native `loading=lazy`](https://web.dev/native-lazy-loading/)).
- **Async decodes** images (using `decoding=async`).
- **Avoids CLS impact** of images by inferring and providing width and height (Supported in Chrome, Firefox and Safari 14+).

#### CSS

- Defaults to the compact "classless" [Bahunya CSS framework](https://kimeiga.github.io/bahunya/).
- Inlines CSS.
- Dead-code-eliminates / tree-shakes / purges (pick your favorite word) unused CSS on a per-page basis with [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/).
- Minified CSS with [csso](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csso).

#### Miscellaneous

- Immutable URLs for JS.
- Sets immutable caching headers for images, fonts, and JS (CSS is inlined). Currently implements for Netflify `_headers` file.
- Minifies HTML and optimizes it for compression. Uses [html-minifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier) with aggressive options.
- Uses [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to bundle JS and minifies it with [terser](https://terser.org/).
- Prefetches same-origin navigations when a navigation is likely.
- If an AMP files is present, [optimizes it](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/optimize_amp/).

#### Fonts

- Serves fonts from same origin.
- Preloads fonts.
- Makes fonts `display:swap`.

#### Analytics

- Supports locally serving Google Analytics's JS and proxying it's hit requests to a Netlify proxy (other proxies could be easily added)
- Support for noscript hit requests.
- Avoids blocking onload on analytics requests.

#### Opportunities (not-yet-implemented)

- Transcode images to webp.
- Transcode images to avif.

### DX features

- Uses ðŸš¨ as favicon during local development.
- Supports a range of default tests.
- Runs build and tests on `git push`.
- Sourcemap generated for JS.

### Customization

- Knock yourself out. This is a template repository.
- For a simple color override, adjust these CSS variables at the top of `css/main.css`.

```css
:root {
  --primary: #E7BF60;
  --primary-dark: #f9c412;
}
```

### SEO & Social

- Share button prefering `navigator.share()` and falling back to Twitter. Using OS-like share-icon.
- Support for OGP metadata.
- Support for Twitter metadata.
- Support for schema.org JSON-LD.
- Sitemap.xml generation.

### Largely useless glitter

- Read time estimate.
- Animated scroll progress barâ€¦
- â€¦with an optimized implementation that should never cause a layout.

### Security

Generates a strong CSP for the base template.

- Default src is self
- Disallows plugins.
- Generates hash based CSP for the JS used on the site.

### Build performance

- Downloaded remote images, and generated sizes are cached in the local filesystemâ€¦
- â€¦and SHOULD be committed to git.
- `.persistimages.sh` helps with this.

### Update Twitter-based comments
```
UPDATE_TWEETS=1 npm run build
```
### Turn on debug mode
```
DEBUG=* npm run build
```
